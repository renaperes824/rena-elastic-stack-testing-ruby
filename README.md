[WIP] Elastic Stack Testing Framework (ESTF)

This project is a work in progress to provide a common automation framework for elastic stack testing.
<br>The goal is to provide a powerful, easy to use and maintain framework to build test suites.  
<br>One main project for this framework is the development of a product integration test suite.
  - Automated Integration Testing (AIT)

This project is in early stage development and many things are still being ironed out.  

More details can be found:
- [Wiki](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-stack-testing/wiki)
- [Kanban Board](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-stack-testing/projects)

## Infrastructure

 - Software products under test: Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, Beats, Cloud, APM, ML
 - Ansible is used to install and configure the software products under test
 - Python, Pytest and Selenium/Webium will be used for the test framework
 - Automated virtual machine support for Vagrant boxes, AWS EC2 and GCP

## Cloud Environment

  Building the `ci/cloud` project requires a [github API token](https://blog.github.com/2013-05-16-personal-api-tokens/).
  The API key will need repo access (repo checkbox).

  Once a github API token has been acquired three environment variables must be set: `GH_OWNER`, `GH_TOKEN`, and `SDK_VERSION`.

  `GH_OWNER` should be set to `elastic` but can be overridden to your fork if necessary.

  `chmod +x getJavaSdk.sh`

  `GH_OWNER=elastic GH_TOKEN=mytoken SDK_VERSION=1.2.0-SNAPSHOT ./getJavaSdk.sh`
